# WGPanel - Node agent installer (production Docker)
# Run this on EACH server that will actually run WireGuard and terminate customer
# connections. It installs Docker, then runs the WireGuard node as a production
# container (deploy/node.Dockerfile image) managed by docker compose - the same
# proven model the in-repo dev node uses, just pulled from the registry and set to
# restart on boot. The container connects OUTBOUND to the control plane (no inbound
# access to the panel needed), applies peer changes via wgctrl, terminates client
# tunnels, and NATs their traffic to the internet.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo bash install-node.sh
#
# You will be asked for:
#   - the control-plane address (e.g. panel.example.com:48443)
#   - a one-time join token, generated from the admin panel: Nodes -> Add Node -> Generate Token
#   - this node's WireGuard subnet .1 address (must match the subnet you set in the panel)
#
# The node image is pulled from $NODE_IMAGE (GHCR by default). If it can't be pulled
# (private package, or before CI has published it), the script falls back to building
# it from source - override the source with WGPANEL_REPO_URL.
